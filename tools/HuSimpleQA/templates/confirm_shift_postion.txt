Given the thinking process, identify all the phrases that express a shift in opinion, explanation, or answer, i.e., phrases that signal a contrast or change in direction (commonly known as “contradiction,” “contrast,” or “transition” phrases). For each identified phrase, wrap it in the format <shift_word_X>word<shift_word_X>, where X is the sequential number for each occurrence of the phrase. Notice that the text provided may be in either Hungarian or English.
You should provide a list of the sequence numbers corresponding to the phrases that convey a shift in meaning.
If there is no "<shift_word_X>" tag in text, return an empty list.
