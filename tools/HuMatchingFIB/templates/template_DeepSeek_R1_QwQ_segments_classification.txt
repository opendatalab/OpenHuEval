Role
You are a text judgement and reasoning expert.

Task Description
Your task is to perform multidimensional classification of the output from a reasoning model. The model's output has been segmented into multiple segments (Introduction, Reasoning, Review, Final_answer), among which there are Reasoning-type segments. You need to classify these Reasoning segments based on the following four dimensions:

Dimensions and Classification Rules:

Dimension 1: Correctness of the Result
Based on the options and the standard answer (std_ans) and the model's answer (model_ans), determine whether the result in each Reasoning segment is correct. The classification is as follows:
Class 1: Completely Incorrect
All blank-filling results in the segment do not match the standard answer.
Class 2: Partially Correct
Some blank-filling results in the segment match the standard answer, while others do not.
Class 3: Completely Correct
All blank-filling results in the segment match the standard answer.
Class 4: Non Conclusion
No conclusion has been provided yet.
Constraints:
If the segment involves multiple blanks, compare each result with the standard answer.
If the segment does not explicitly mention the blank-filling results, infer based on the context.

Dimension 2: Reasoning Complexity
Determine whether the reasoning process in each segment is a simple assertion or involves complex thinking. The classification is as follows:
Class 1: Simple Assertion
The segment directly provides the answer without detailed reasoning.
Class 2: Complex Thought
The segment includes repeated thinking, logical reasoning, hypothesis validation, or other complex processes.
Constraints:
If the segment contains keywords such as: “Wait, perhaps...”,“I need to consider...”,“Alternatively...”,“Hmm, maybe...”,“Let me think...” classify it as “Complex Thought.”
If the segment only directly provides the answer (e.g., “#1# is H.508”), classify it as “Simple Assertion.”

Dimension 3: Reasoning Scope
Determine whether the reasoning in each segment involves modifying any previously solved blanks. The classification is as follows:
Class 1: Only Current Blank
The segment only provides an answer for the unresolved blank and does not modify previously solved blanks.
Class 2: Modify Previous Blanks
The segment not only provides an answer for the unresolved blank but also modifies or corrects previously solved blanks.
Class 3: Current Blank and Consecutive Blank
The segment provides an answer for the current unresolved blank and also addresses consecutive blanks, either by solving them or making adjustments.
Constraints:
If the segment explicitly mentions modifying previously solved blanks (e.g., “Wait, I need to change #2# to...”), classify it as "Modify Previous Blanks."
If the segment only focuses on the current blank, classify it as "Only Current Blank."
If the segment addresses both the current blank and consecutive blanks, classify it as "Current Blank and Consecutive Blank."

Dimension 4: Language Transfer
Determine whether each Reasoning segment includes the process of translating Hungarian into English. The classification is as follows:
Class 1: Contains Language Transfer
When language transfer occurs in the reasoning process (e.g., translating Hungarian sentences or words into English), classify it as "Contains Language Transfer."
For example, the segment includes a translation content similar to:
- “Erőteljes #3# és a költői #4# gazdag használata jellemzi.” This translates to “It is characterized by strong #3# and rich use of poetic #4#...”
- "\"Az egyiptomi állam élén a #0# állt.\" This translates to \"At the head of the Egyptian state stood the #0#..."
- "Now, \"Angliában 1215-ben adták ki a #3#.\" This is \"In England, in 1215, they issued the #3#...\""
- "The options are H.leghosszabb (longest) or A.legrövidebb (shortest).。。"
Class 2: No Language Transfer
The segment does not include the above translation process.
Constraints:
If the segment contains an explicit translation process (e.g., “This translates to...”), classify it as “Contains Language Transfer.”
If the segment only uses Hungarian or English without translation, classify it as “No Language Transfer.”

There's also mention of dividing the territory of Attica into ten parts, each contributing members to a council, and having their own military units.

That seems correct because Cleisthenes tied citizenship to place of residence, creating new political tribes based on where people lived, rather than their noble lineage.\n\n- #6# is about the 10 units created in Attica. I chose 'K. phülét,' which I believe means 'tribes.' That seems right.\n\n- #8# is about the leaders of the military units within these tribes.

Peloponnészosz' is the Peloponnesian, which doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nI think my choices are mostly correct, but I might need to adjust #8# if 'sztratégosz' isn't the best fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps #8# should be 'Vitéz János,' but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each tribe had its own officials, and maybe 'főpohárnok' or some other title, but those aren't in the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, 'B. sztratégosz' might be the best available choice, even if it's not perfectly accurate.\n\nAlright, I think I'll stick with my initial choices.",

        'text': "Now, double-checking some points:\n\n- #4# is about tying something to place of residence, leading to the creation of 10 units in Attica. I chose 'E. polgárjogot,' which is citizenship rights. That seems correct because Cleisthenes tied citizenship to place of residence, creating new political tribes based on where people lived, rather than their noble lineage.\n\n- #6# is about the 10 units created in Attica. I chose 'K. phülét,' which I believe means 'tribes.' That seems right.\n\n- #8# is about the leaders of the military units within these tribes. I chose 'B. sztratégosz,' which is strategos, but I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate. Maybe I need to consider another option.",

        'text': "Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to the local officials within the tribes, like 'phylarch.' But since that's not in the options, and 'sztratégosz' is the closest, I'll stick with that.\n\nAlso, I notice that 'N. ötszázak' is \"five hundred,\" which refers to the Boule, but I already used 'M. bulé' for that.\n\nSimilarly, 'P. Peloponnészosz' is the Peloponnesian, which doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nI think my choices are mostly correct, but I might need to adjust #8# if 'sztratégosz' isn't the best fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps #8# should be 'Vitéz János,' but that doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that each tribe had its own officials, and maybe 'főpohárnok' or some other title, but those aren't in the options.\n\nGiven the options provided, 'B. sztratégosz' might be the best available choice, even if it's not perfectly accurate.\n\nAlright, I think I'll stick with my initial choices.",
